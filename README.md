An example file is provided, taken from https://www.tablab.app/app?sample-id=flights-1m

Using `uv` as a build tool is strongly recommended. Get it from https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/.

Boilerplate for a demo app is included under `src/hyperdev`; you can run it using the command `uv run -m hyperdev main`
